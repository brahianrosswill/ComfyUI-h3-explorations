"""Record the shape of every H3 attention call, for someone else's bench.

The sage fork's accuracy and speed benches cover LTX 2.3 and Z-Image shapes
and have **zero H3 coverage**, so every rtol and every speed number either
project cites is measured on the wrong workload for this one. Their own
discipline forbids adding bench shapes without profiling a real trace first.
This produces that trace.

Deliberately env-gated and inert by default: importing it costs nothing and
patches nothing. `H3_TRACE=/path/to/out.json` turns it on for one process.

What it records, and why each field is here rather than inferred:

  seq, heads, head_dim   the actual attention shape. Previously the fork had
                         two points for H3, both inferred from a docstring and
                         a log line in this repo.
  dtype                  bf16 is assumed everywhere; assumption, not evidence.
  module                 **`unknown`, always, and corrected here 2026-09-08.**
                         This used to say "`dit` or `refiner`", and the one
                         call site passed "dit" for every call, so every
                         refiner call was labelled a DiT one. The forward we
                         patch replaces `Attention.forward` on the CLASS, and
                         both DiTBlock and RefinerBlock instantiate the same
                         `Attention`, so the call site cannot tell them apart.
                         The point the old text made is still true -- the
                         refiner runs a much shorter sequence and folding the
                         two would report a bimodal workload as one average --
                         but `seq` is what separates them, not this field, and
                         `seq` is part of the counter key, so no data was ever
                         lost. Split a trace on seq; do not trust this field.
  has_mask, has_scale    constants, and true by construction rather than
                         assumed: `Attention.forward(self, x, rope_freqs=None,
                         transformer_options={})` has nowhere to carry a mask
                         or a scale. The old text called them "the coverage
                         question", which described a risk this path cannot
                         run: a call carrying either would have to come from a
                         different signature.
  route                  TWO different things share this name, which is worth
                         reading twice. `record(route=...)` is passed
                         "entered" at the single call site and is the
                         DENOMINATOR: every attention call, whatever happened
                         next. Attribution is `h3_trace.route(seq, outcome)`,
                         a separate function called at five exits in
                         attention.py -- sage, sage_chunked, fallback_kernel,
                         fallback_chunked, sol_delegate -- which uses the key
                         stashed at entry. So the numerator does NOT have to
                         come from the fork's get_dispatch_counts, though
                         comparing the two would be a real cross-check and
                         nothing here does it yet.

**Nothing covers this file.** No `bench/check_*.py` drives it, and
`docs/checks.md` has no row for it, so the five outcomes above are
correct-by-construction: no one has forced each case and confirmed the field
lands where it should. Treat a share computed from it as unverified until
that exists.
