"""Encode an H3 reference list once, and write prompts on top of it.

`MiniMaxH3ReferenceConditioning` (`reference_conditioning.py`) presents the
references and the prompt to Qwen3-VL as one sequence and encodes it whole, so
a prompt edit pays for the references again. Nearly all of that is the encoder
reading the stills (`bench/results/2026-10-03_prompt_edit_conditioning_cost.json`).

Core places every reference ahead of the prompt
(`comfy/text_encoders/minimax.py::MiniMaxH3Tokenizer`) and the language
model's attention is causal (`comfy/text_encoders/llama.py::Llama2_.forward`),
so what the encoder computes for the references cannot depend on the prompt.
The two nodes here split the work along that line:

  MiniMaxH3EncodeReferences   the references alone: the vision tower, the
                              language model over each reference's span, the
                              VAE rows. Its inputs do not include the prompt,
                              so ComfyUI's node cache keeps its output across
                              prompt edits.
  MiniMaxH3PromptOnReferences the prompt tokens alone, attending to the
                              references' kept keys and values.

## What is the same as the one-node path, and what is not

Measured on the shipped encoder with one 2048 still
(`bench/results/2026-10-03_encoder_prefix_reuse.json`): the references' rows
are the same bytes as the one-node path's at that shape; the prompt's rows
differ in the last bits (relative difference of a few millionths, where the
int8 encoder sits a few thousandths from bf16). The owner accepted that
difference on 2026-10-03. At other shapes the references' rows may also differ
in the last bits. Nothing here is the default: every shipped graph still wires
the one-node path.

## The store

A reference's span depends on everything ahead of it and on nothing after it,
so spans are kept one per reference under a chained content key: the hash of
what the language model is handed for that span (token ids, the still at the
encoder's view) and of the key before it. A changed image, size, label or
position is a different key, so an entry cannot be stale, and nobody has to
remember what was encoded where. Changing the last reference reuses the ones
before it; moving a reference to another position is a miss, encoded fresh.

The store lives in host memory for the session, least recently used out
first. `STORE_BYTES` caps what it keeps beyond the chain in use, which is held
whatever it weighs. Nothing is written to disk (owner, 2026-10-03: about 3 GB
per 2048 still is not practical to persist). It serves one encoder at a time:
a different encoder object, or new patches on it, empties it.

Nothing kept stays on the card. A pass hands each layer its kept keys and
values as the loop reaches it and drops them after, so the card holds one
layer's worth at a time, not the chain's (a review by a peer session,
2026-10-03: the whole chain on the card would come out of the DiT's room
after a render).

Not kept across a miss: the vision tower's output and the VAE rows. A moved
or changed reference pays for both again, and the encode node runs every
reference's VAE encode each time it executes.

## The loop below is a copy of core's

`Llama2_.forward` cannot continue more than a few tokens from kept keys and
values: its causal mask is square over past plus new, and its list path
collects no keys when handed an empty list. `_lm_pass` is that loop with the
mask cut to the new tokens' rows. `bench/check_reference_encode.py` pins the
source of the core functions it copies, and the bench node
`bench/comfy_capture_nodes/h3_bench_prefix_reuse` holds it to core's output on
the real encoder.
