# Rebuild and install comfy_kitchen's Sol-Attn kernel from a source checkout.
#
# **This used to say "from kijai's branch", and that the checkout it built from
# was SOMEONE ELSE'S REPO.** Sol-Attn is upstream now and the default source
# moved to our own fork clone (see SRC below); the leave-it-as-you-found-it
# design did not move, because every checkout under coderef/ is shared with
# other agents and a tree left dirty blocks the next pull. That is the design:
#
#   2026-08-14: the version-tag edit was left as a working-tree modification
#   on the theory that a future `git pull` would then conflict loudly rather
#   than silently reverting it. It does not conflict -- it BLOCKS:
#
#       error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.
#
#   A guard that stops the owner updating a dependency is worse than the drift
#   it was guarding against. The edit is made by this script for the duration
#   of a build and reverted on every exit path.
#
# Why the edit exists at all: the source declares a plain version ("0.2.31",
# "0.2.32", ...), identical to the PyPI wheel ComfyUI pins, so a fork build
# and the stock wheel are indistinguishable to `pip list` -- and a stock wheel
# silently has no sol_attn, which makes every Sol call fall back to dense with
# no error. PEP 440 still matches `X.Y.Z+sol.<sha>.up.<base>` against
# `==X.Y.Z`, so a plain requirements install stays satisfied and will not
# clobber it -- but only while X.Y.Z is exactly ComfyUI's pin (see "Track
# upstream main" below for what happens when it is not).
#
#   2026-09-03: this used to be `git apply vendor/patches/001-local-version-tag.patch`,
#   a diff hardcoded against `version = "0.2.31"`. Upstream released 0.2.32 on
#   2026-09-02 and the patch stopped applying on any checkout based on it; the
#   first build of our blk_cnt branch rebased onto v0.2.32 found that. The
#   version line is now rewritten by sed, whatever it says, so the script no
#   longer carries a copy of upstream's version number that has to be kept
#   in step with upstream.
#
# Usage:  vendor/rebuild_kernel.sh [CUDA_ARCH]     (default 89, this box's 4090)
#         vendor/rebuild_kernel.sh --check         (is the source current? builds nothing)

# --- Track upstream main, carry ours on top (owner, 2026-09-27) ---------------
# We carry our Sol commits (blk_cnt, qk_balance, rotate) indefinitely and take
# everything else from upstream MAIN, not from a tag: kitchen moves faster than
# its releases, and the owner wants its frontier ("so long as we know what
# exists where and why"). What makes that safe is that the build names its
# own contents. The wheel installs as `<declared>+sol.<ours>.up.<base>`: the
# version upstream's pyproject declares, our tip's short sha, and the upstream
# main commit our commits sit on. Every bench record carries that string
# (provenance.py, substrate.py), and the build record below adds the base's
# date, its distance past the pinned tag, and the carried commits.
#
# The gate below refuses only what would make that string lie or the build
# unusable: a source that does not contain ComfyUI's pinned tag, or a source
# whose base is not on upstream main. A declared version other than the pin
# is a WARNING, not a refusal: PEP 440 then stops matching the pin, so a later
# `pip install -r requirements.txt` swaps in the stock wheel. That is loud,
# not silent: MiniMaxH3SolAttn refuses at patch time on a wheel without
# qk_balance (sol_attn_h3.py::_apply_patch), and this script's --check names
# the installed build. Rebuild after any requirements install.
#
# Until 2026-09-27 the base had to be the tag ComfyUI pins, and untagged main
# was "not built by policy". That kept kitchen's int8 attention work (#207,
# #208) and the fp16_conv3d depth gate (#192) out for a release cycle; the
# last tag-based build is `h3-build` at 8176242 (0.2.35+sol.8176242), which
# every render through 2026-09-27 ran on.
#
# `--check` runs only the gate.
#
# Derived from this checkout, not typed: the repo sits at
# <comfy>/custom_nodes/<pack>, so ComfyUI and its venv are two levels up.
# Override with COMFY=... / PY=... for any other layout.

#                   retired 2026-09-27, kept because every record before then
#                   cites it
#   sol-blk-cnt-pr  PR 168's head, our commits on upstream main; for the PR
#                   only, and deleted when the PR closes
#   archive/* tags  retired builds that records here cite by sha, kept

# clone is shared with other agents, a rebase rewrites a branch they may be
# reading and needs a force-push to the fork, and a merge needs neither. Every
# sha a record ever cited stays on the branch. It stays manual on purpose: an
# automatic merge would make what is in the build depend on when it was last
# built. --check says how far upstream main has moved past the build's base;

# third_party/cutlass (comfy_kitchen/backends/cuda/CMakeLists.txt). A fresh
# clone or a new worktree -- which every pin move makes -- leaves them empty,
# and the build then dies deep in the compile with `flash.h: No such file or
# directory`, naming neither the cause nor the fix. That happened on
# 2026-09-01 and three postmortems carried the missing check. So the build
# brings every top-level submodule to the commit the checked-out source
# records, every time: when a rebase onto a new tag moves a pin, the next
# build follows it and nothing has to be remembered.
#
# "Latest" here means the source's own pins, never the submodules' upstream
# heads (`git submodule update --remote`). The tag was built and tested
# against these commits; a moved head would appear nowhere in the
# `+sol.<sha>` version, so two builds with one version could differ; and it
# would modify the gitlinks the clean-tree check below reads.
#
# Top-level only, as docs/SOLATTN.md's manual recipe does: the build reads
# nothing under flash-attention's own submodules (its csrc/cutlass, and
