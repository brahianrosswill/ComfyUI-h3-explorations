"""Reject machine-owner home paths in repository text artifacts.

Model and media locations are runtime inputs. Persist logical names, hashes,
dataset revisions, and repo-relative paths instead of usernames or home roots.

## What it scans, decided 2026-10-05

**The files git would take**: tracked files, plus untracked files no ignore
rule covers, which are the ones the next `git add` can pick up. That is the
repository; a path in it leaves this machine.

**Not the gitignored trees.** `internal/` and `data/` hold session notes, raw
captures and run scripts that are never distributed, and a raw capture's
first line records where it ran. Until this date the walk covered them, and
the check was red on those lines alone, with no tracked file among them, so
it could not say whether the repository was clean. Scrubbing them would mean
rewriting other sessions' dated notes for no reader.

Two ways to look wider. `--include-ignored` walks everything under the root,
as the check did before. A root given on the command line that is not this
repo is walked whole, ignore rules or not, because a staging tree being
prepared for upload is published whatever this repo's `.gitignore` says:

    python bench/check_no_owner_paths.py <staging tree>
