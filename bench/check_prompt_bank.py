"""The prompt bank's gate, where the sweep can see it.

`bench/build_prompt_bank.py --check` is the gate on `prompt_bank/`: every
prompt grades clean at its own length, no entry has a shape problem that is
not recorded, and `docs/prompt_bank.md` is the table the bank would write
today. `bench/run_checks.py` runs files named `check_*.py`, and the gate is
not named that way, so a sweep never ran it. On 2026-10-06 it was found red
at a commit whose sweeps had all been green (a bank entry ending in a
newline, with two shape findings). This file is the gate under a name the
sweep runs. It grades nothing itself: one copy of the rules, in the builder.

The exit code is the builder's: 0 clean, 1 a finding or a stale table, 2 an
empty bank, which is nothing graded.
