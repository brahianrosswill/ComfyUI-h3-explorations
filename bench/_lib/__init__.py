"""The three things a `bench/` check kept writing for itself.

    from _lib import bootstrap, needs, case, finish

A check runs as `python bench/check_x.py`, so `bench/` is `sys.path[0]` and
`_lib` imports with no setup. `docs/checks.md` "Running them" says what each
exit code means; this file is where two of them are produced.

`bootstrap()`
    Makes ComfyUI core importable and keeps it off a card it cannot see.
    Importing almost anything under `comfy` or `comfy_extras` pulls
    `comfy.model_management`, which picks a torch device AT IMPORT and raises
    "No CUDA GPUs are available" when `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` hides the card.
    The switch is `comfy.cli_args.args.cpu = True`, set before that import.
    Most checks that import core set it by hand; the ones that forgot read as
    red in a masked sweep on 2026-10-05 although none of them uses a device
    (the list is in that day's CHANGELOG entry).
    `workflows/build_workflows.py::_core_cpu_when_no_card` is the same switch
    for the generator.

`needs(what, present)`
    Exit 2, "nothing graded", when something the check cannot run without is
    not there: a card, a dataset, an environment variable. A missing resource
    is not a failure of the thing under test, and a check that returns 0
    without grading reads as a pass: `check_correctness.py` and
    `check_clone_v_wiring.py` both printed "skipping" and returned 0.

`server_memory_mode()`
    For a script that calls core's nodes in process on the card: sets up the
    dynamic VRAM layer the server sets up at start. Its docstring says why
    that is not optional there.

`case(name, fn)` and `finish()`
    One `ok` / `FAIL` line per case and one exit code: 1 when any case failed,
    2 when none failed but one could not run (`skip(reason)` from inside it),
    0 otherwise. For a new check, or an old one whose own loop was this
    already; nobody is asked to port a check that has a harness.

Nothing here imports torch or ComfyUI at module level, so a check that only
wants `needs` pays for nothing else.
