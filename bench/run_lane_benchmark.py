"""The masked lane's scoreboard: every judged shot of every window, each render's metrics beside the eye's verdicts.

One row per render per shot: what the turn metric says, what the motion
metric says, and what a person said, with who and on what. It runs no model
and reads no media: the poses come from `bench/measure_subject_yaw.py`'s
records, the verdicts and the provenance of every clip from
`bench/turn_metric_eye_verdicts.json`.

**What it buys** (card `build-metric-suite`): one page that answers "which
arm holds the turn, follows the motion and keeps the look, on which clip",
for as many clips as the verdicts file names, so a choice between two arms
is not made on the one clip somebody happened to look at. It is accepted
when the owner reads an arm's row and it says what they saw.

**What goes in.** The verdicts file's `windows`: a stretch of a source clip
with where it came from, what it may be used for, and `poses`, the pose
record made from it. Its `sets`: one shot of a window, judged by a named
reader. A window with no `poses` is listed as not measured, with the
command that would make the record. A shot the source has and nobody judged
is measured and shown with no eye column.

**What comes out, per shot and per render:**
- turn: the end facing's distance from the source's in degrees, for the
  shoulders and for the head, the chin lift's distance beside them, and
  the verdict, which is the shoulders' at the tolerance
  (`measure_subject_yaw.py::TOLERANCE_DEGREES`).
- motion: `followed` and `in_step` over the joints the source moves, the
  best time shift, `stray`, and the verdict at
  `measure_subject_motion.py::FOLLOWS`. The parts the source moves are
  named, since a score on the arms and a score on the whole body are
  different claims.
- look: the eye's verdict only. No look metric exists yet.
- per shot, per metric: whether the metric orders the renders as the eye
  did, and how many of its verdicts match where the eye said yes or no.

**What it cannot say.** A shot with one verdict from the eye orders
nothing: agreement there is on the verdict alone. Every limit of the two
metrics carries over; this adds none and removes none.
