"""Which rendered recipes have a graph in this repo, and which have none.

    H3_OUTPUT_DIR=<share> python bench/clip_recipe_coverage.py --since 2026-09-24 --task r2v i2v
    python bench/clip_recipe_coverage.py --root <dir> --skip private --recursive

An experiment is only kept if its graph is. This reads the graph each clip was
rendered from (the first-frame PNG beside it, via `diff_clip_graphs.graph_of`),
reduces it to a recipe, groups the clips by recipe, and says which graphs under
`h3_config.graph_paths(include_bench=True)` carry the same recipe. A group with
no match prints its nearest graphs, the ones that share the checkpoint and the
LoRAs, so the difference is one line to read.

**The recipe is what decides the output, not how the graph was built.** It is
the task, the checkpoints, each LoRA with its strength and block selection, the
sigma schedules, the sigma shift, and VSA's keep percent. It leaves out the
seed, the prompt, the images, the canvas and every filename, which are inputs
and not recipes, and it leaves out Sol-Attn and the attention chain. The last is
deliberate: Sol became the default in every video graph after the first
distill renders, so a clip from before that has a recipe that a graph today
matches except for attention, and the tool prints `sol`/`nosol` beside each
group so that difference is visible and does not hide a match.

**Limits.** It compares what the graph says, not what the code did with it (see
`diff_clip_graphs.py`). A group that matches on recipe but whose graph was built
for another scene (the market-scene reference graphs, for one) is a match here;
the prompt and images are not part of the recipe. A clip with no readable
sidecar is counted and skipped, never guessed at. The H3ExactLoRA graphs of
`standalone/h3_mutant_distill` are not in `graph_paths` (they are UI files), so
the mutant repo's own renders match through the pack graph they were parity
checked against (`bench/check_mutant_parity.py`), by recipe, not by node class.

Reads PNG sidecars only. No GPU, no server.
