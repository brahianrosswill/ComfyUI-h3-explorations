"""Run every `bench/check_*.py` with the card masked, and say what is red that should not be.

    <comfy venv python> bench/run_checks.py
    <comfy venv python> bench/run_checks.py --only sol --logs /tmp/sweep
    <comfy venv python> bench/run_checks.py --changed

One row per check: its exit code, its wall time, and the line that explains a
result that is not green. Then a verdict against `bench/checks_baseline.json`.

## What the three results mean

    0      green: every case the check has was graded and passed.
    2      nothing graded: the check needs something this run does not have (a
           card, a dataset, the server). Expected when masked, never a failure.
    other  red, including a crash and a timeout.

`docs/checks.md` "Running them" is the standard for those codes. A check that
needs a resource says so through `bench/_lib::needs`.

## The baseline

`bench/checks_baseline.json` names the checks that are red for a stated reason,
one line each. **This script exits 1 only when a check is red and the baseline
does not name it**, so a sweep before a commit has one answer. A baseline entry
that is no longer red is printed as STALE and does not change the exit code;
delete the entry, because a stale one would cover the next real red.

## The targeted sweep

`--changed` runs the checks that the files changed in the working tree can
turn red, and says which and why. `--since <commit>` adds the files changed
since that commit. The rule:

- **A node file changed: every check runs.** A node file is a module at the
  repo root, the shared constants, the generator, a generated graph, a
  vendored config or this harness (`is_node_file`). The owner's rule is the
  full sweep before a schema, default or loader commit, and nothing short
  of reading the diff can say a root module's change is not one.
- **Otherwise:** a changed check itself, every check whose source names a
  changed file (by its module name for a script, by its file name for
  anything else), and `ALWAYS`, the checks that read the whole tree.

It is a way to be quick on a bench tool or a record, never a substitute for
the full sweep where the rule above asks for one; it prints which it was.

## What a sweep is not allowed to do

Every check is started with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` (empty), so nothing here
reaches the card while somebody renders, and with `H3_CHECK_SWEEP=1`
(`bench/_lib::SWEEP_ENV`), which a check that would otherwise queue a render
reads and refuses on. `PYTHONPATH` is passed through untouched and not added
to: a check that needs it and does not bootstrap shows up red, which is the
point.

It does not replace `bench/smoke_h3.py`, which submits to a live server and is
not a `check_*.py`.
