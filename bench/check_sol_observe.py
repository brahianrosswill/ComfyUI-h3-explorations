"""Grade the Sol route observer before it is given a render.

The observer's value is that a row can be trusted to describe the call it
came from: the right prompt, the right block, the counts the kernel actually
produced, and a failure that stops the capture rather than thinning it. So
the cases are about identity, completeness and non-perturbation; the count
semantics themselves are pinned upstream (`tests/test_sol_attn.py` on our
comfy-kitchen build branch, `h3-build`) with closed-form equalities at both
tau extremes.

Claims, i.e. what breaks if a case is deleted:

  inert_without_the_env_var
      unarmed, the node passes NO `blk_cnt` keyword, writes nothing, and its
      output is the same bytes as a direct kernel call. This is the `enabled()`
      defect class `pdd_observe.py` shipped (`bool(str(Path("")))`), and the
      compatibility claim for an older installed wheel.
  every_route_is_recorded
      one row per override call for every exit -- masked, dense_block,
      outside_range, ineligible, sol, kernel_error -- with the route name and a
      reason, plus header and config rows. A recorder that only saw Sol calls
      would report a render as all-Sol. The kernel_error call RAISES out of the
      override with the kernel's exception as its cause and never reaches the
      dense fallback: a failed Sol call rendered dense is a render that
      succeeds and is not a Sol render.
  identity_does_not_mix_prompts
      two calls under two executing contexts carry two prompt ids, read at
      call time; the conditioning uuids and cond_or_uncond lists are recorded
      whole. This is the cached-patched-model case.
  wrong_slice_is_red_and_escapes_the_fallback
      a count tensor above NTB, below its forced floor, or with a sink_q row
      not at NTB is written as an `error` row AND raises out of the override;
      the dense fallback is NOT called. A recorder that swallowed its own
      failure would leave a plausible partial file and a finished render.
  summaries_agree_with_an_independent_reduction
      the row's densities and per-head means are recomputed from the raw
      sidecar bytes with a reduction written here, not imported, including
      the forced floor from a set-based definition and the CRC.
  armed_with_old_wheel_fails_at_patch_time
      `_require_kernel` raises when armed against a `sol_attn` without
      `blk_cnt`, and passes unarmed. Otherwise an armed server on a stale wheel
      renders and records nothing.
  stale_block_index_is_not_trusted   (CPU)
      core publishes `block_index` before each DiT block and never clears it,
      so the next step's text-only refiner calls see the last block's index
      beside a layout they are shorter than. A refiner-shaped call under
      `block_index` 49 is recorded with no block, `scope: unknown` and no sink
      pair; the same options on a full-length call record block 49 and the
      layout's sink pair, which is the red control that the gate is not simply
      dropping every index. Replaced `stale_block_label_is_cleared`, whose
      subject (the node's own `sol_block` hooks and the Morton forward's
      `finally`) was deleted with the old node on 2026-09-27.
  apply_sol_records_core_block_and_fallback   (CPU)
      `_apply_sol` on a real ModelPatcher, armed, with empty dense_blocks:
      the installed override records the block index core published (7), and
      the config row names the node and its dense fallback. Then a foreign
      override is put on the hook, as an attention node placed after Sol
      would; the node's ON_PREPARE_STATE callback puts Sol back on top with
      the foreign override as its fallback (a short call reaches it), a second
      run is idempotent, and the next config row names the foreign override
      as `dense_fallback`. Red control: before the callback runs, the foreign
      override IS on top, so the case sees the takeover it exists to undo.
      Replaced `observer_only_block_indexing`, whose subject (the old node's
      block hooks) was deleted.
  raw_off_writes_no_sidecar
      `raw=0` leaves no `.u16` file and no raw pointer, and the row is
      otherwise complete.
  composed_patch_calls_are_recorded
      **the integration hole Codex's review found (2026-09-01).** On the
      canonical graph Sage's per-block forward patch sits under Sol, and
      Sol's composition gate hands a declined call straight to it, so the
      override -- and its recorder -- never runs for the 50 DiT calls of an
      outside-window step. Drives `_compose_module_patch` with a foreign
      forward: outside the window and below min_tokens the foreign forward
      runs, the stock forward does not, and one `route: composed_patch` row
      appears with the gate's verdict leading the reason. The full-length call
      carries core's block index; the short one (below min_tokens, so
      refiner-shaped) is shorter than the layout and records no block. Inside
      the window the stock forward runs and the wrapper writes nothing (the
      override records that call in a real render).
  forced_metadata_is_computed_not_inferred
      `forced.sink` is the clamped sink cardinality and `diag_min/max` the
      diagonal contribution outside sink_q: no sink gives 0 / 2 / 3, a sink
      overlapping the diagonal gives 4 / 0 / 3. The first revision reported
      the MINIMUM of the sum as the sink, which reads 2 with no sink at all.
  query_and_pair_weighting_differ_on_nonuniform_forced
      Codex's five-block fixture (counts all 4, no sink, forced [2,3,3,3,2]):
      the query-weighted `routed_density.mean` is 0.5667 and the
      pair-weighted `ordering_effect_density` is 0.5833, both to 1e-9, so the
      two names cannot be read as one number.
  render_row_names_the_workflow
      the first call under a prompt id writes a `render` row: the running
      graph is read from the server's queue, hashed as provenance.py hashes
      it, and matched to the shipped file -- `h3_text_to_video_pdd_api.json`
      submitted as-is names itself, carries `summary.pdd` with the LoRA and
      its linked step count, and is `process_render_index` 0; a modified copy
      under a second prompt id gets a null `workflow_file` with a reason and
      index 1 with the first id as prior; without a server the row says the
      prompt was unavailable. This is what lets a reader tell a PDD record
      from a base one, and a cold render from a warm one, without the file.
  undefined_adaptive_figures_are_null
      every query block inside sink_q leaves no free pair: `routed_density`
      is null, `ordering_effect_density.overall` is null with numerator and
      denominator both zero, every per-head and per-segment adaptive value is
      null, and `kernel_density` is still defined. The first follow-up
      emitted {"weighting": "query"} with no mean there -- truthy, so a
      reader indexing `mean` would have raised (Codex's follow-up review).

The cases marked (CPU) run anywhere the node imports, and so do
`armed_with_old_wheel_fails_at_patch_time` and
`query_and_pair_weighting_differ_on_nonuniform_forced`. The rest need CUDA and
an installed comfy_kitchen whose `sol_attn` takes `blk_cnt`. Exit 0 all
passed, 1 a case failed, 2 the kernel cases were not graded (no CUDA, or no
`blk_cnt`) even when the CPU cases passed, rather than passing on a weaker
path.

The block index and segment bounds come from core
(`transformer_options["block_index"]` and `["minimax_h3_layout"]`, read
through `h3_layout`); the fixtures here stand in for both with a layout stub
whose `seq_len` is the call's length.
