# What made what: models, adapters and the 2026-09-26 renders

Written 2026-09-27 by the VAE session (vaedude) with fastdude, for the
owner's question: which model file is what, which is a hybrid of what, which
code made it, what it is good and bad at, and which files in `Video/` and
`latents/` came from it. It covers every render we queued on 2026-09-26/27
(196 rows across 19 run records) and everything in `latents/`.

fastdude's half, `2026-09-27_inventory_fastdude.md` (5cc342d8), has each
record's time window, the contamination notes, and good/bad-at per distill;
its rankings table is quoted below. The per-render detail is
`2026-09-27_render_inventory.json`, from
`bench/render_inventory.py` (0e02db17). It resolves each row's graph as
rendered, applies its patches, and lists every output file. File names below
are basenames, relative to the output share. **Everything here is one seed and
at most a few scenes per arm. Rankings are our reading, not a measurement.**
The mp4 encoder's dark blocking (`2026-09-27_o1_lossless.md`) is left out.

## How the output files are named

- **Clips**, in `Video/`: `<graph prefix>_<label>_000NN.mp4` (silent),
  `..._000NN-audio.mp4` (with sound) and `..._000NN.png` (first frame).
- **Final latents**, in `latents/`: `<graph prefix>_video_<label>_000NN_.latent`
  and `..._audio_...`, written by the `_savelat` graphs. Any of them can be
  decoded again with `h3_decode_saved_latent_api.json`, with no sampling.
- **Per-step predictions**, in `latents/`:
  `<graph prefix>_x0_<label>_<stamp>_<step>_video.latent`, one per sampling
  step, from the `_x0` graphs (`step_x0_observer.py`).
- **Labels** are `<scene>__<arm>`, for example `look_anchor__pdd8_s085`: the
  look_anchor scene, PDD8 at strength 0.85. Unlabelled names (`ship`,
  `r64_branch`, `scout`) are the earlier single-purpose runs listed under each
  model below.

## The model files, and what each one is

| file | what it is | made by | used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot` | **The base.** MiniMax H3 FL2VA (text/first-last-frame to video+audio), pruned curve form, int8 | Comfy-Org release | every base, PDD and FlashGen render |
| `minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_int8_convrot` | The base's reference-to-video partition | Comfy-Org release | ref2va renders |
| `fastvideo_fasth3_8step_v2_pruned_int8_convrot` | **FastH3 V2**: FastVideo's full fine-tune of fl2va (data-free DMD2, trained with VSA sparse attention), plus 50 VSA gates | FastVideo release (FastVideo-FastH3-Comfy) | FastH3 renders |
| `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot_fasth3adaln` | **Hybrid (ours):** the base's weights with FastH3's timestep conditioning (time table + all adaln projections), no gates | `bench/build_adaln_swap.py` @ 91db4fc2 | the swap test |
| `fastvideo_fasth3_8step_v2_pruned_int8_convrot_baseadaln` | **Hybrid (ours):** FastH3's weights and gates with the base's timestep conditioning | `bench/build_adaln_swap.py` @ 91db4fc2 | the swap test |
| `fastvideo_fasth3_8step_v2_pruned_int8_convrot_temb_a05`, `_a075` | **Hybrid (ours), never rendered:** FastH3 with its conditioning blended 50% / 75% toward FastH3 from the base | `bench/build_adaln_blend.py` @ 135b449e | nothing (see "Safe to delete") |
| `loras/h3/minimax_h3_fl2va_pdd_8step_comfy` | **PDD** (alibaba-pai's parallel decoding distill, 8 steps on a 32-point grid) converted for ComfyUI: backbone LoRA, adaln baked into fl2va's curve basis, 32-head output bank | `bench/convert_pdd_lora.py` @ eb791f8, from `MiniMax-H3-FL2VA-Acc-8Step` | every PDD render |
| `loras/h3/minimax_h3_fl2va_fasth3temb_pdd_8step_comfy` | **PDD re-baked onto FastH3's conditioning (ours), never rendered.** Loads only on `..._fasth3adaln` | `bench/convert_pdd_lora.py` via `bench/build_pdd_base_shim.py` @ cb21249c | nothing (see "Safe to delete") |
| `loras/h3/minimax_h3_flashgen_4step_v1.0_768p_fl2va_pruned_rank64_comfy` | **FlashGen** (Beidouqixing's data-free 4-step VSD distill) at its full rank 64, converted exactly | `bench/convert_flashgen_lora.py` @ c7ad7f06 (0.142.1) | every FlashGen render |
| `loras/h3/minimax_h3_flashgen_4step_v1.0_768p_ref2va_pruned_rank64_comfy` | The same, re-fitted to ref2va's time basis. An untested transfer: FlashGen was trained on FL2VA | `convert_flashgen_lora.py --partition Ref2VA` @ e7d08d19 | ref2va FlashGen |
| `loras/h3/minimax_h3_4step_lora_flashgen_v1.0_768p_fl2va_pruned_avg_rank_13_bf16` | kijai's FlashGen conversion: resized to about rank 13 (keeps about 95% of each delta) | kijai (HF `Kijai/MiniMax-H3-experimental`) | one comparison render (`r13`) |
| `minimax_h3_video_vae_int8_convrot` | The video VAE, int8. **The shipped default since 2026-09-26** | Comfy-Org release | most renders |
| `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16` | The video VAE, fp16 (the official fp32 cast down) | official release | the int8-vs-fp16 comparisons |
| `taeh3` | A tiny approximate decoder, for draft previews only | madebyollin | the scout drafts |

The lightx2v turbo LoRA appears in one smoke row (`smoke_turbo_branch`); that
lane is retired (0.156.0).

## What each configuration made, and what we think of it

### Base (fl2va, 16 steps): the reference
- **Rows**: `distill_run` (`<scene>__base`, 9 scenes); `distill_compare_s1`
  (`diner_base`, `subway_base`); `subway_v2_s1` (`base`); `ref_pathway_1344`
  (ref2va, 11 rows). The base's prompts predate the 0.154.6 bank edits, so they
  do not pair with the distills' rows.
- **Read.** The quality reference: the most natural motion, and slow (16
  steps).

### Base at 8 steps on FastH3's settings (`fl2va_contract`)
- **Rows**: `fasth3_swap`, three scenes. `clone_base_x0` (`subway_chase__base_euler32`,
  32 Euler steps on PDD's grid, with 32 per-step x0 latents) is the related
  clone control.
- **Read.** Under-converged, soft, almost static: the floor, not something to
  use. The 32-step control drew the same two people at 1 s as PDD8, which is
  how the clone was traced to the seed and prompt.

### PDD8 (fl2va + the PDD sidecar)
| arm | label suffix | read |
|---|---|---|
| **PDD8, exact branch** (the default) | `__pdd8` (13 scenes, looks, spec) | Natural, flatter and dimmer than the others (the owner: "the latter usually - but usually naturally so"), and the least motion. The flat look is a defect in some scenes, worst in lamp-lit interiors (`2026-09-26_distill_signatures.md`). Quietest audio. |
| PDD8, merged into int8 | `__pdd8_merge` | A different take with the same character and the same audio (`2026-09-27_ladder.md`). No reason to prefer it. |
| **PDD6** (tail-weighted six steps) | `__pdd6` | Within 5-10% of PDD8's detail at three quarters of the steps. The faster-PDD candidate. |
| PDD4 | `__pdd4` | 22-32% less fine detail, the least motion, more boil. Not recommended. |
| PDD8 at strength 0.85 / 0.7 | `__pdd8_s085`, `__pdd8_s07`, `__pdd8_s07all` | Worse: less detail and motion, and the flat grade is unchanged (`2026-09-27_pdd_strength.md`). Keep 1.0. |
| **PDD8, then FlashGen finishing** (reverse switch) | `subway_chase__rev_h080`, `__rev_h063` | Keeps PDD8's take and lifts its dim highlights to the others' level. The best fix for PDD8's look so far, on one scene (`2026-09-27_reverse_switch.md`). |

### FlashGen (fl2va + the rank-64 LoRA through the exact branch)
Per fastdude, pending their review:

| arm | label suffix | read |
|---|---|---|
| FlashGen, full | `__flashgen`, `r64_branch`, `ship`, `scout` | Fast (4 steps). Hazy, lifted blacks, coolest colour, brightest audio. Follows role and direction beats less well than the base. |
| **FlashGen, blocks 34-49 only** | `__flashgen_blk34_49` | A finished 4-step render with deeper blacks and about half the haze. **The candidate best FlashGen setting**, pending the owner's eye (fastdude's FT1). |
| FlashGen, blocks 0-33 only | `__flashgen_blk0_33` | Broken: near-black. |
| FlashGen, blocks 0-49 | `__flashgen_blk0_49` | The same as full; the refiner and final layer do not matter. |
| FlashGen at 0.8 / 1.2 | `__flashgen_s08`, `__flashgen_s12` | Different takes. Latent spread rises with strength, which fits the haze scaling with it. |
| FlashGen without adaln | `__flashgen_noadaln` | About the same as full: FlashGen barely touches the timestep conditioning. |
| FlashGen, dense attention | `__flashgen_dense` | fastdude's read. |
| FlashGen merged into int8 (the old path) | `r64`, `subway_r64`, `fast_r64` | Loses most of FlashGen's delta, which is why the exact branch became the default. |
| kijai's rank-13 resize | `r13` | Lossy by construction. The rank-64 conversion is exact. |
| FlashGen on i2v / on ref2va | `i2v_flashgen`, `r2v_flashgen`, `*_fp16`, `*_int8` | It holds up by eye off T2VA (`2026-09-26_flashgen_tasks_s1.md`). Ref2va is an untested transfer. |

### FastH3 V2
| arm | label suffix | read |
|---|---|---|
| **FastH3, FastVideo's contract** (10/3, its 8 trained steps, VSA keep 20% from step 0) | `__fasth3`, `contract` | The most fine detail and chroma of every distill on 13 of 13 scenes, warm and saturated. The owner: "super high detail like almost way too much ... ai generated in polish". |
| FastH3, ComfyUI template settings | `template`, `contract_attn`, `contract_sampling` | Off FastH3's training contract; use the contract. |
| FastH3, VSA off | `__fasth3_novsa` | Half the fine detail, with the grade shifting. It removes the sparsity and the learned gates together (fastdude, 1eacb74f). |
| FastH3 weights + base conditioning | `__swap_baseadaln` | Near frame-identical to FastH3 (`2026-09-27_fasth3_swap.md`). |
| Base weights + FastH3 conditioning | `__swap_fasth3adaln` | Near frame-identical to the base at 8 steps: under-converged. |

The swap showed that FastH3's speed and its look live in its weights and VSA
gates, not in its timestep conditioning.

### Reference pathway (#26), ref2va at 1344x768
- **Rows**: `ref_pathway_1344_arms`. Graphs are `h3_probe_ref_pathway_<arm>`,
  labels `typed_both`, `typed_encoder`, `native_both`, `native_encoder` and
  `fl2va_encoder`, at two seeds (20260930-31) plus a warmup.
- **What it asks**: how reference images reach the model. Typed or native
  reference roles, through both paths or the encoder only, and fl2va with
  encoder-only references.
- **Status**: blinded as `ref_pathway_1344_2026-09-26` with four controlled
  pairs, key sealed, **not scored yet**. No ranking until the owner scores it.

### VAE and draft runs (not model comparisons)
- **`int8_vae_e2e_s1`, `int8_vae_tasks_s1`** (`ship_int8`, `r2v_fp16`,
  `r2v_int8`, `i2v_fp16`, `i2v_int8`): the int8 VAE against fp16, on FlashGen
  renders. The owner could not tell them apart, int8 is about 12 s faster per
  render, and it became the default.
- **`draft_decode_s1`** (`ship`, `draft`, `keep`, `int8`) and the
  **`scout_*`** runs (`scout`, `full`, `warmup_full`): taeh3 draft previews
  and their full decodes. The owner declined drafts (not worth it; taeh3
  ghosts).
- **`telemetry_overhead_s1`** (`ship`): the first pipeline telemetry records.

## Rankings, 2026-09-27 (provisional: one seed, mostly measured, not judged)

fastdude's table, by use (from `2026-09-27_inventory_fastdude.md`):

| use | ranking | basis |
|---|---|---|
| close-ups, dialogue, low motion | PDD8 > FastH3 > FlashGen | owner reads, detail and grade measures |
| black-and-white, rich blacks | PDD8 > FlashGen > FastH3 | chroma leak (FastH3 worst), shadow depth (FlashGen shallowest) |
| detail | FastH3 > PDD8 ≈ FlashGen | detail measure on every look; FastH3's is "too much" by eye |
| natural grade | PDD8 > FastH3 > FlashGen | owner's "naturally so"; FlashGen's haze, FastH3's orange pull |
| speed | FlashGen > FastH3 ≈ PDD6 > PDD8 | sampler times in the rows |
| FlashGen configurations | r64 exact branch = late-only candidate > r13 > r64 merged | int8 requant loss; FT1 |
| PDD configurations | exact 8 ≈ reverse switch (brighter) > PDD6 > PDD4 > merged | the ladder and reverse reads |

Our joint picks, to try first:
- **Default look, any scene:** PDD8, exact branch.
- **PDD8 where its flat, dim grade bothers you:** PDD8 then a FlashGen finish
  at 0.8 (the reverse switch). Tested on one scene.
- **Faster PDD:** PDD6.
- **Fastest usable:** FlashGen with `blocks="34-49"`, pending your eye; full
  FlashGen if the haze does not matter for the scene.
- **Most detail:** FastH3 on its contract, knowing it over-polishes.
- **The quality reference:** base fl2va at 16 steps.

Not recommended:
- PDD4;
- PDD at strength below 1;
- FlashGen blocks 0-33 (broken);
- the merged FlashGen path;
- FastH3 on template settings;
- both swap hybrids (research only);
- the base at 8 steps.

## Safe to delete (the owner's call)

Built on a reading the swap renders overturned, and not worth keeping for
use. About 84 GB together (`du -h` on 2026-09-27).
- `fastvideo_fasth3_8step_v2_pruned_int8_convrot_temb_a05` and `_a075`, 21 GB
  each: never rendered.
- `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot_fasth3adaln` (20 GB) and
  `fastvideo_fasth3_8step_v2_pruned_int8_convrot_baseadaln` (21 GB): their
  question is answered.
- `loras/h3/minimax_h3_fl2va_fasth3temb_pdd_8step_comfy` (1.1 GB): never
  rendered, and it loads only on a hybrid above.
- The unpruned FastH3 V2 download (66 GB, under the owner's Storage, not in
  ComfyUI's models folder) served the #4 read and nothing else.
- `internal/pdd_shims/` is local and gitignored.
Each can be rebuilt from its script and commit.

## What's in `latents/`

- **Final latents, video and audio**, one pair per `_savelat` render: every
  `__pdd8`, `__pdd8_*`, `__pdd6`, `__pdd4`, `__flashgen*`, `__fasth3*`,
  `__swap_*`, `__fl2va_contract`, `scout` and `warmup_*` label above. They
  are for re-decoding without sampling, and for the latent reads.
- **Per-step x0 latents**:
  - 8 each for `subway_chase__pdd8`, `__pdd8_s085` and `__pdd8_s07`;
  - 32 for `subway_chase__base_euler32`.
  They are the clone read's inputs (`2026-09-27_clone_base_control.md`), and
  the biggest group by count.
- **`_contaminated_2026-09-26/`**: fastdude's quarantine of the first launch's
  PDD and FlashGen latents, rendered under the branch-stacking bug fixed in
  0.154.8 (`2026-09-26_followup_contamination.md`). Not usable.
- **`h3_block_propagation/`, `h3_dense_block_cost/`, `h3_exact_verify/`**:
  older probe outputs, not from yesterday.

`bench/render_inventory.py --unclaimed` lists anything no run row names.
