"""CPU acceptance checks for the typed MiniMax H3 reference runtime.

No server, weights, or CUDA are used.  ComfyUI is imported in CPU mode so the
real custom-type/schema API and the installed H3 preparation helpers remain
the authority; video and audio VAEs are small recording stubs.

This check covers the boundary the pure graph resolver cannot see: append
nodes must be copy-on-add, VHS metadata must describe the wired frames, video
must be normalized from the owned loaded rate to 24 fps, mono must become
stereo, audio must stop at the aligned target duration, the opt-in release
video policy must keep its VAE and duration-aware Qwen views distinct, and one
ordered walk must produce Qwen items and DiT blocks with the sounded-video 2:1
shape.

Two policies exist at each stage, `comfy` (the default: what core does, and
nothing pre-applied) and `release` (the release's own processor declaration,
read through `vendor_config`). The cases here hold them apart on one input,
which is the only way a selector that quietly collapses to one branch goes
red. A third policy, `encoder`, bound to a contract the AWQ adapter stamped on
its CLIP; that lane closed on 2026-09-13 (`docs/roadmap.md` "Closed lanes")
and its arms left with it. The guarded loader `h3_encoder_loader.py` still
records core's bounds, and the static preflight prices against them.
