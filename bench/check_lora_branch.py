"""`MiniMaxH3LoRABranch` computes the merged LoRA exactly, on every module an H3 LoRA targets.

`lora_branch.py` adds a LoRA at the call instead of merging it. The claim is
narrow: **on an unquantized model, the branch equals the merge.** So this runs
core's real `MiniMaxH3Model` (two blocks and a two-block token refiner, float32
on CPU) through the node's object patches, and compares its output with a copy
whose weights hold `W + strength * alpha / rank * B A` and `bias + diff_b`,
merged in float32. The synthetic LoRA targets every module kind the FlashGen
file does: `qkv_proj`, `out_proj`, `fc1`, `fc2`, the block and final-layer
`adaln_proj.linear` with a `diff_b`, and the token refiner's blocks.

**Three controls, each a plausible way to get it wrong that still produces
tensors of the right shape**, and each must move the output off the merge:

    unscaled   alpha / rank dropped (the stub's alpha is not its rank)
    no fc2     the MLP's forward patch left out, which is what patching
               `fc2.forward` would amount to on the int8 path
    no diff_b  the adaln bias delta dropped

Also: a key the node cannot place is refused, and a forward another node
already patches is refused.

**Key names** (2026-10-05). `native_keys` renames a Kohya-style file
(`lora_unet_<path with underscores>.lora_down.weight`) through core's own
table, `comfy.lora.model_lora_keys_unet`. The synthetic LoRA is re-spelled
that way and must still equal the merge; a Kohya name for a block the model
does not have must reach `parse_lora` unrenamed and be refused; a native file
must come back as the same object. The stub model here is not core's
`MiniMaxH3` class, so core's H3-only rule (the bare module path, no prefix) is
read in `comfy/lora.py` and not exercised.

**What this does NOT establish:** anything on the int8 checkpoint or the card.
That the branch keeps what the merge loses there is
`bench/results/2026-09-26_int8_lora_requant.json`'s measurement, and whether
it shows in a render is a render's.
