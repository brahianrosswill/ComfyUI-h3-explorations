"""DuckDB ingest and static dashboard for Sol probe and observer captures.

Ingests `sol_probe_*.jsonl` (H3_SOL_PROBE, `sol_block_probe.py`) and
`sol_observe_*.jsonl` (H3_SOL_OBSERVE, `sol_observe.py`) into a DuckDB file,
defines the views below, and writes a dashboard of tables computed from them.
The dashboard carries no prose findings: every number on it is a query result,
and the query is printed beside it.

**A run is a capture directory.** Every row carries `run`, the name of the
directory its file sits in, so runs are never pooled by accident. Rewritten
2026-10-02: the earlier version keyed rows by `prompt_id` alone (the probe's
`capture` label is null on older records), defaulted a missing schedule index
to step 0, and pooled every run into one block profile on the dashboard.

Views, each keyed by `run`:

  sol_runs              one row per run: settings, settings digest, seed,
                        prompt hash, cell/skip counts, probe granularity
  sol_probe_cells       one row per compared call (whole-call metrics)
  sol_probe_heads       per-head metrics, unnested
  sol_probe_segments    per-segment metrics, unnested
  sol_observe_calls     one row per observed DiT call, with route and density
  sol_joined_analysis   probe cells joined to their observer call
  sol_matched_steps     sigmas that every loaded run measured
  sol_matched_cells     cells on (sigma, block) pairs every loaded run measured
  sol_run_summary       per run: all-cell and matched-population error
  sol_run_cost          per run: attention cost in block-equivalents
  sol_block_profile     per run and block, on matched steps: relative and
                        absolute error
  sol_replicates        per block, runs that share a settings digest

**Why the matched population.** `dense_blocks` and `start_percent` remove
cells from what the probe measures, so the all-cell average and maximum fall
when the worst blocks or steps go dense even if no measured cell changed.
`sol_matched_cells` compares runs on the cells all of them measured.

**Why block-equivalents.** A dense block or an out-of-range step costs a full
attention call; a Sol call costs roughly its kernel density (sinks included).
Routed density over Sol calls alone ignores the dense calls a config adds.

**What the probe cannot see.** Its reference is the chained fallback on the
identical q/k/v (`sol_block_probe.py::_header`), so a cell is local error at
one call. Error carried into later steps or blocks shows up only as a change
in their inputs, never as a term in any cell.
