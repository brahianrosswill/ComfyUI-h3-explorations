"""Is token_aug's run-to-run variation a selection flip or accumulation order?

Stage 2 of the token routing plan found that with bit-identical inputs, the
`token_aug` arm's output on one captured block varies between runs while the
other four captured blocks and every plain arm are bitwise identical
(`bench/results/2026-09-08_token_aug_stage2_reproduction.json`). That says the
variation belongs to the `token_aug` code path. It does NOT say what varies,
and two very different mechanisms produce the same symptom:

  a SELECTION flip     the set of extra tokens admitted changes between
                       launches. comfy_kitchen's `sol_attn` docstring says
                       this cannot happen -- "whole histogram bins only, so
                       the set never depends on scheduling" -- so if it is
                       this, that claim is wrong as written.

  ACCUMULATION order   the set is fixed and the exactly-attended contributions
                       are summed in a different order, which float addition
                       does not commute over. Ordinary, contradicts nothing,
                       and present in many CUDA kernels by design.

## The discriminator

Not the number of distinct outputs. That was the first version of this file
and it is the wrong statistic: hashing the whole tensor makes ANY differing
element a distinct output, so one flipped value and a global drift both read
as "30 distinct over 30 runs". It classified a case with a max delta of 423
as reduction noise.

The statistic is the DISTRIBUTION of the deltas:

  accumulation order   many elements differ, each by a reduction-scale amount.
                       Summing the same contributions in a different order
                       cannot produce a large change in any one output.

  a changed SET        few elements differ, and some differ enormously,
                       because a different token contributing means a
                       different answer rather than a rounder one.

So: what fraction of rows moved at all, what fraction moved by more than the
output's own scale, and how the largest delta compares to the mean magnitude.

## What this cannot settle

It cannot prove a selection flip, only make one much more or less likely: a
kernel could in principle vary its accumulation order across a small fixed set
of schedules and produce clustering too. Reading a cluster count as a set
count is the error to avoid. And it says nothing about which set is right --
`bench/measure_sol_exact_variants.py` grades accuracy, this only asks whether
the answer is stable.
