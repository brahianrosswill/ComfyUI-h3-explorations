"""Which way a person faces, frame by frame, in a render and in the source it was made from: a number for "did he turn".

The masked lane's question on a moving shot is whether the replaced subject
moves as the original did. On 2026-10-05 it was answered by reading five
frames of a contact sheet per render
(`bench/results/2026-10-05_masked_v2v_motion_arms.md`). This measures it.

**What it buys** (card `build-turn-metric`, the owner's ask): a number per
clip in place of a reading by eye, so that the per-step half of the same
card can say at which sigma the facing is decided, and a knot list for a
distill can be placed there. It applies to a shot where the subject turns
and the source's mask is kept. It is accepted when it puts the clips already
judged by eye in the same order, and the record says where it does not.

**The measurement.** Core's SAM 3D Body predictor runs on the subject's box
in each sampled frame and returns 3D keypoints in the camera's frame. The
yaw is the direction of the line from the right shoulder to the left
shoulder in the horizontal plane: 0 degrees facing the camera, 90 side-on,
180 with the back to it. The hips give a second reading of the same thing,
recorded beside it. Nothing about the model's own rotation parameters is
used: the root rotation it reports is the rig's, not the body's
(`pred_global_rots[0]` is the identity on every frame probed), and its
`global_rot` Euler angles wrap where the shoulder line does not.

**The box** is the source's kept mask (`mask_store.py`, the file under the
output folder's `masks/`), fitted to the render's canvas by the same centre
crop the song node gives the frames (`comfy.utils.common_upscale`,
"center"). A masked render regenerates the subject inside that mask, so the
source's box finds the new subject too. A window with no kept mask can give
the box two other ways: `--mask-video`, a mask saved as a video from the
window's first frame (what a Subject Track graph writes when its mask is
sent to a video), or `--find-box`, which asks the body model itself and is
for a clip with one person in it. `--find-box` invents a person in an empty
frame, because the body model always returns a pose; a mask does not.

**More than one shot.** The source's cuts are found with the Subject
Track's own cut finder and written as `shots`. A turn is a property of one
shot, so the comparisons are made per shot (`by_shot`), and `--reanalyse`
with `--shot` reads one.

**The head beside the shoulders.** Each reading also carries the head's
facing, from the line between the ears, and each comparison the chin's
lift, from the nose against that line. A singer who turns the head to a
microphone faces one way with the body and another with the head, and the
eye reads the head. Both are reported under `head`; the verdict stays the
shoulders', the reading that was calibrated.

**Per clip, against the source over the same frames:** the yaw at the end
of the shot (the circular mean of its last `END_SAMPLES` samples), its
difference from the source's, the mean difference over the shot, the first
sampled frame from which the two stay apart by more than the tolerance, the
largest turn (how far the yaw gets from where the shot began, which tells a
part-turn that comes back from no turn at all), and a verdict: `holds` when
the end difference is within the tolerance, `fails` otherwise. With `--eye` the clips' by-eye verdicts are read from a JSON
(`bench/turn_metric_eye_verdicts.json`) and the output says whether the end
differences put them in the same order (every "yes" below every "partial"
below every "no").

Not measured: anything but the facing. A clip can hold the turn and lose
the look, the lip sync or the hands; those stay with the eye.

In its own process, not through a server. Masked it runs on the CPU, which
is how the 2026-10-05 calibration ran. On the card ask whoever holds it
first; `bench/_lib::server_memory_mode` is called for that case.
