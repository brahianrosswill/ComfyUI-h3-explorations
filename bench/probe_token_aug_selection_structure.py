"""Where does token_aug's run-to-run variation sit, and does it have the shape
of a per-centroid selection set?

`bench/probe_token_aug_determinism.py` established that the variation is not
accumulation order: on block 49 the deltas are many times the output's own mean
magnitude on a small fraction of rows. It could not say what varies, and its
record says the admitted set "is not observable from outside the kernel".

That sentence is half wrong, and this file is the correction. The kernel's own
source says exactly how the set is chosen (comfy-kitchen, branch
`sol-blk-cnt-0.2.33`, `comfy_kitchen/backends/cuda/sage_attention/
sol_attn_token.cu`, the file's header comment and pass 2):

  * A centroid is shared by TOK_GROUP neighbouring query blocks, so the unit of
    selection is TOK_GROUP * BLOCK contiguous token rows, per head.
  * Pass 1 histograms every candidate token's score. Pass 2 admits WHOLE BINS
    from the top until the next bin would overflow `n_tok`, and thresholds at
    that bin's lower edge. So the boundary is a bin edge, not a rank cut --
    which is why open experiment 29's arm 1, "the gap between the last admitted
    token's score and the first rejected one", names a quantity the kernel does
    not compute.
  * A token that clears the threshold reserves a slot with
    `atomicAdd(&tok_cnt[...])` and is only listed `if (slot < n_tok)`.

The last point is the mechanism this probe is built to look for. The kernel's
docstring claims the selected set "does not depend on scheduling", and that
holds only while the number of tokens clearing the threshold is at most
`n_tok`. If ever it is more, the losers are decided by the order the atomics
land in, which is a scheduling-dependent set -- the exact symptom on block 49.

## What this measures, and what it cannot

It measures the SHAPE of the moving rows, per head, against the shape the
mechanism predicts:

  a SELECTION flip     moving rows cluster inside a few TOK_GROUP*BLOCK-aligned
                       windows, because one centroid's admitted set changed and
                       every query row sharing that centroid sees it.

  anything per-token   moving rows scatter across windows, roughly one window
                       per moving row, because nothing ties them together.

The discriminator is rows-per-touched-window, whose null value is about 1.0.
The null is not asserted from theory: every arm permutes its own moving rows
within each head and recomputes the same statistic, so the run carries a
scattered control measured by the same code on the same movement.

Clustering alone would not separate a shared centroid from two neighbouring
query blocks, so `halves_stats` adds the alignment test and its shifted-grid
control; its docstring says what each grid means.

What it does NOT test is whether the unstable windows are the same set in every
launch. Each launch is compared against the first, so an unstable window can
agree with the first by chance and go uncounted; identity is the wrong test and
the record reports the pairwise overlap and the union instead.

**It cannot observe `tok_cnt`.** Whether a window's admitted count actually
exceeds `n_tok` is one out-parameter away -- the same shape as the `blk_cnt`
parameter this fork already added -- and until that exists this probe can
support or refute the mechanism's fingerprint but never confirm it. Clustering
at the centroid's granularity is consistent with a changed admitted set and
with any other per-centroid effect; a scattered result is what would refute it.
