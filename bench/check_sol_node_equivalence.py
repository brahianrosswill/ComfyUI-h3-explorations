"""Grade our Sol node's DISPATCH against the algorithm's own eager reference.

## What this covers that `check_solattn_correctness.py` does not

That file grades the KERNEL against the algorithm's eager reference. This
grades everything our node (`MiniMaxH3Sol`) does AROUND the kernel: the
BHND-to-BTHD transpose and back, the scale it forwards, the sink pair it
derives from core's layout, and the selection it passes (tau, with the pooled
tail on and top-k off, always: `_TAIL`, `_TOPK_RATIO`). A defect in any of
those produces a plausible tensor of the right shape and a successful render.

The distinction is the reshape. `optimized_attention` hands H3's attention over
as BHND with `skip_reshape=True`, the kernel wants BTHD, and the output goes
back as BHND. Getting that wrong transposes heads against tokens -- which does
not raise, because both are legal sizes.

## The oracle is the KERNEL, not the algorithm, and the first draft got that wrong

This file was first written to compare the dispatch against the eager
reference, and the numbers looked like a marginal failure: cosine ~0.994 to
0.998 depending on shape and seed, sometimes under the bar. The instinct was
to loosen the bar. That would have been wrong twice over.

Measured instead: **the dispatch is BITWISE identical to a direct
`comfy_kitchen.sol_attn` call** on the same inputs. Every bit of that spread
was the kernel's INT8 arithmetic against fp32 -- which is not the node's doing,
is a property `check_solattn_correctness.py` already owns, and would have been
silently absorbed into a loosened tolerance here.

So the oracle is the kernel. That gives an exact claim rather than a tolerance,
it isolates the layer this file is about, and it needs no O(T^2) score tensor,
so it runs at a realistic sequence length instead of a toy one. **A tolerance
where an equality is available is a check that cannot see small defects.**

## Why it no longer compares against the vendored node

**It used to, and that comparison is finished rather than broken.** Until
2026-08-30 this file asserted that our forked node produced the SAME BYTES as
the vendored upstream one at the shipped settings, which is what made migrating
145 graphs safe. It passed, at both selections, and the result is recorded in
`bench/results/2026-08-30_sol_node_equivalence.json`.

That comparison cannot be re-run and should not be resurrected. `vendor/`
now holds the PRE-MERGE upstream drop, restored to be a pristine reference:
its `_run` passes `centroid_tail` to a kernel that no longer accepts it, so it
raises rather than producing a baseline. Keeping a check that can only skip
would be worse than none -- so the baseline moved to the algorithm, which is
the more durable control anyway and one this repo already trusts.

Claims, i.e. what breaks if a case is deleted:

  dispatch == kernel       the node's override (`make_override`, as
                           `_apply_sol` builds it) produces the SAME BYTES as
                           calling `comfy_kitchen.sol_attn` directly with the
                           transpose done by hand, the tail on, and the sink
                           pair `sink_ranges` gives for the layout core
                           published. Catches a transpose, a dropped scale, a
                           sink pair built wrong or not derived, or a
                           selection other than tau-with-tail. A dense
                           fallback that raises stands in for the chained
                           kernel, so a declined call fails the case rather
                           than matching by accident.
  sink pair reaches        a non-zero sink must change the output. The sink is
    the kernel             derived from H3's layout and passed through two
                           call frames; if it stopped arriving, every
                           conditioning row would be routed sparsely and the
                           render would merely look worse.
  tau reaches the kernel   RED CONTROL. tau is the node's one selection knob.
                           If a different tau does not move the output, it is
                           not connected and the equality above compares a
                           knob that does nothing. (Replaced the pooled_tail
                           control on 2026-09-27: the node no longer exposes
                           the tail, so its one live knob carries the control.
                           The top-k dispatch case went with top-k, which the
                           node no longer reaches.)
  (an OOM exits 2, not 1)  a resident model or a render in flight can leave
                           too little VRAM for these shapes. That is an
                           environment state, not a result. Until 2026-09-04
                           the guard for it wrapped nothing and the check
                           died on a raw traceback with exit 1; now the
                           kernel cases run under `graded_kernel_cases`,
                           which catches the allocator's error, names the
                           cases that were not graded, and exits 2.
                           `--oom-control` proves that with the card masked:
                           a kernel stub that raises on its first call must
                           come back as 2 with no case marked.

  a transposed oracle      RED CONTROL, and the one that earns this file.
    is caught              Compares against a kernel call with heads and tokens
                           swapped. If that still matches, the equality above
                           is not seeing layout at all.

  the sink pair per mode   CPU, pure, run BEFORE the CUDA gate. `_sink_blocks` on a
    (no kernel)            fixture layout for every `sink_conditioning` mode:
                           off is zeros; exact_kv has no dense-query range;
                           exact_kv_and_rows starts the range at the target
                           audio and leaves reference rows sparse;
                           exact_kv_and_all_rows covers every conditioning
                           row; the no-audio-span fallback of exact_kv_and_rows
                           IS the all-rows range; on a t2v-shaped layout the
                           two ranges differ by the text rows alone and on a
                           ref2v-shaped one by the reference rows; a missing
                           video span or a short sequence is zeros in every
                           mode; an unknown mode is refused; and the node's
                           combo lists exactly the modes the function accepts,
                           with the shipped default among them.

  the container entry      CPU, through core's own `wrap_attn`, run BEFORE the
    (no kernel)            CUDA gate. The override carries a
                           `container_function` exactly when its fallback
                           does. A dense block then hands core's containers
                           to the fallback's container entry untaken, and
                           the tensor is gone once that entry has consumed
                           it, which is the point: no frame of ours holds
                           it. RED CONTROL: the same override with the
                           attribute removed reaches the fallback's tensor
                           entry with the tensor still alive, so the case
                           can see a held reference. A call Sol takes gets
                           tensors, an ineligible one goes back to the
                           fallback in containers, and an armed probe's
                           fallback run gets the same q, k and v.
  container entry ==       on the card: a call Sol takes through the
    tensor entry           container entry is the same bytes as through the
                           tensor entry.

Needs CUDA and a comfy_kitchen carrying the merged `sol_attn` for the kernel
cases; the sink and container cases run anywhere the node imports. Exit 0 all passed, 1 a
case failed, 2 the kernel cases were not graded (no CUDA, no kernel, OOM),
even when the sink cases ran and passed.
