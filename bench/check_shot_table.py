"""The per-shot table says what the tracker did, and its person numbers mean one thing everywhere.

`shot_table.py` turns the Subject Track's per-shot state into a table a
person reviews in place of a render. It is wrong quietly: a row that names
the wrong person sends a reviewer's correction to somebody else, and a shot
reported on screen when its mask is empty is a shot nobody looks at again.
The tracker's own logic is driven here (`subject_track.follow`) on the
stand-in world `bench/check_subject_track.py` builds, so the table is read
off a real result and not off rows typed for the purpose.

  numbering_is_left_to_right     person K is the K-th mask from the left,
                                 ties to the higher one, from 1; the same
                                 person keeps the same number whatever order
                                 the detector returns; `detection_of` undoes
                                 `person_number`. Delete and the tile, the
                                 table and a typed correction can each mean a
                                 different person by "person 2".
  rows_cover_the_clip            one row per shot, every frame in exactly one.
  subject_number_names_the_mask  the number a row gives the subject resolves
                                 to the mask the tracker took, on a shot
                                 where the detector's order and the numbering
                                 DIFFER (asserted first, or the case could
                                 not fail).
  absent_shot_says_so            a shot holding only other people is absent,
                                 not on screen, names no subject, and names
                                 the closest person, who is on that frame.
  on_screen_is_counted           frames with the subject are counted off the
                                 mask handed in, not off the shot's length.
  every_row_has_the_slots        the caption slot, the version and the
                                 numbering sentence are there; `corrected`
                                 is empty on a tracker with no corrections
                                 and carries the tracker's own words when a
                                 shot has them, in the JSON and the text.
  text_says_what_json_says       the text has one row per shot with the same
                                 numbers, and the JSON survives a round trip.
  labels_sit_on_their_outlines   each number's point lies on the top edge of
                                 its own mask's box.
  save_node_writes_three_files   the save node writes JSON, text and one
                                 picture under core's counter, and refuses a
                                 string that is not a table and a table of
                                 another version.
  kept_table_is_written_beside   what the song node calls after its video:
                                 the bundle's table lands as `<stem>_shots`
                                 JSON and text, and a bundle with none writes
                                 nothing.
  shipped_graphs_wire_the_table  every shipped graph whose Masked Source
                                 takes the tracker's mask also takes its
                                 table, from the output the schema names.
  gaps_are_listed                inside a shot the subject is in, the frames
                                 the mask leaves empty are listed as runs, in
                                 the JSON and the text; a shot with no
                                 subject lists none, since `on_screen` says
                                 it. A track the tracker seeded again inside
                                 a shot is listed with where it let go, where
                                 it was found and what it scored, and so is
                                 every frame probed after the loss. Delete
                                 and a gap in a mask is something a person
                                 finds in the render.
  gallery_travels_in_the_table   the subject as the picked shot's track
                                 showed them is in the table, survives JSON,
                                 and reads back as the signatures the run
                                 kept; a table without one, a missing file
                                 and text that is no table are refused by
                                 name, because handing in nothing would be
                                 today's pick rule in silence.
  tracker_emits_the_table        the Subject Track declares the table as its
                                 last output, after mask, preview, report.
                                 Skipped until the tracker carries it.

What this cannot check: that the numbers are legible on a real tile, or that
a person finds the table quicker than a render. No model, no CUDA, no server.
