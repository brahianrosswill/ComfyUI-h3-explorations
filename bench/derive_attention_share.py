"""What fraction of an H3 sampler is attention, bounded from an A/B we already ran.

**A bound, not a profile.** Nothing here profiles anything: it re-reads a
rendered ladder and derives what the arms imply. That distinction is the whole
point, because the number gets quoted as though it were measured directly.

## The derivation

The ladder rendered the same scene, seed and length under three attention
configurations that differ ONLY in the attention op. Let `N` be the
non-attention sampler time, which is the same in all three, and `A_x` the
attention time under configuration `x`:

    dense:  N + A_dense = t_dense
    sage:   N + A_sage  = t_sage
    sol:    N + A_sol   = t_sol

Three equations, four unknowns, so the system does not solve. But `A_sol >= 0`
gives `N <= t_sol`, and that is enough for a floor under each share:

    A_dense / t_dense >= (t_dense - t_sol) / t_dense
    A_sage  / t_sage  >= (t_sage  - t_sol) / t_sage

Both are FLOORS. The true shares are higher, because neither sage nor Sol
makes attention free -- `A_sol > 0` strictly, we simply have no arm that
bounds it above.

## Which share answers which question

The dense figure is what supports "attention dominates H3". It is a statement
about a configuration nobody renders in.

The sage figure is the one an Amdahl argument needs: in the configuration that
actually ships, how much is left for an attention kernel change to win. Using
the dense share to rank kernel work overstates the ceiling, which is the error
this record exists to stop. Written 2026-09-08 after a sister project was
about to rank its roadmap on the dense number.

## What this cannot say

Sampler time only. VAE decode is outside it. Bounds, not point estimates. One
seed. And the dense-versus-sparse step split that produces `t_sol` is specific
to the ladder's step count and shift -- `docs/open_experiments.md` warns not
to reuse it -- so a different step count or clip length needs its own arms.
