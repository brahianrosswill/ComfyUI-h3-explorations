"""Write the manifest for the 2026-09-26 follow-up batch: the distill run's
remaining arms on the 0.154.0 code, and the tests its predictions need.

The distill run (`make_distill_run_manifest.py`) was stopped after its base
arms: every later arm ran PDD on the merged path, and the owner's 0.154.0
change applies every LoRA on int8 at the call ("if you need to stop the renders
because they dont make sense anymore, please do so, and then restart comfy from
a place where you can actually test all the code you guys wrote"). Its base
arms (`er_sde`, no LoRA) are code-independent and are reused as they are.

The batch is ordered by priority, so a partial night still answers the main
questions. Each group's `why` names the predictions it tests
(`bench/results/2026-09-26_distill_run_predictions.md`). Every arm saves its
latent (a `_savelat` or `_x0` twin), so path distances need no decode.
