"""Controls for the prompt grader's rules, and its copies of the guide's closed sets.

A rule that has never been seen to fail is a requirement, not a control. Three
escapes earned this file (all 2026-10-01, found by reading the code against the
rules it claimed to enforce, not by any check):

1. **The stamped-header FAIL fired on one spelling.** The owner's rule is that a
   shot header carries no timestamp. The test was "the body opens with a capital
   `At` and a digit", so `at 00:05.200,`, `The shot cuts at 00:05.200 to` and a
   malformed `[Shot 2, 00:05.200]` header all passed, the last by emptying the
   shot list and switching off every rule that reads shots. Each spelling is a
   case here, and so are the three legal forms that must stay green: a mid-shot
   time in its own sentence, a clock on a sign in quotes, and a time of day.
2. **The retention-line speaker-id test read only `(S1)`**, so the compound
   `(S1,S2)` passed where a single id failed.
3. **The song node's prompts were not graded at all**, and its audio sections
   were waived because the graph has no `VAEDecodeAudio`. The song graph is
   graded through `bench/preflight_graph.py::grade_template`; each way it can
   fail is mutated in memory here.

The second half pins the closed sets the grader keeps COPIES of against the guide
they come from. They agree today; nothing made them disagree loudly. Sections,
the two marker sets and the task types are compared with
`check_prompt_guide_conformance.parse_guide` (the guide parsed at run time);
amplitude, speed and the cut phrases are parsed from `vendor_guides/base_en.md`
here; the marker strings are compared with the release's declared special tokens.
