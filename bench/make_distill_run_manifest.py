"""Write the manifest for the 2026-09-26 fresh distill run: many bank scenes, four models, one seed.

The owner, 2026-09-26: FlashGen's prompt adherence "needs badly to be tested. I'd
use a diverse set of scenes from prompt bank. Varying lengths and goals based on
the json metadata in prompt bank". Seed-matched clips are different scenes per
distill (`docs/h3_distills.md`), so the comparison is across many scenes,
judged against each scene's beat checklist (`bench/adherence_checklists.json`),
not across seeds of one scene.

Arms are grouped by model, so the card loads each model state once. Every arm
patches the scene's prompt by bank id and its `MiniMaxH3Resolution.length` to
the scene's declared frames, so no arm renders a prompt off its length.

    python bench/make_distill_run_manifest.py [--graphs graphs.json] --out bench/distill_run_arms.json

`--graphs` maps each role to a graph path: the saved-latent twins, once built.
Without it, the shipped graphs.
