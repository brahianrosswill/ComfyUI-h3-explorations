"""Where a masked song render's seconds go: by node, and by stage inside the song node.

Three sources, joined on the prompt id of one render:

  the runner's row      `bench/run_graph_arms.py`'s JSONL: seconds per node from the
                        websocket feed, the total, the patches, the substrate.
  the song node's report  `MiniMaxH3AudioFreezeSong` times its own stages
                        (`audio_freeze_song.py`, `mark`): per window "[N] seconds: ..."
                        and at the end "seconds by stage, T in all: ...". Read from a
                        saved `/history` outputs file, one per label.
  the telemetry record  `pipeline_telemetry.py`'s JSONL, optional: which models core
                        loaded while the song node ran, and when.
  the server's log      optional: the sampler's progress bar, for the seconds each step
                        took, and Sol-Attn's first sparse line, for how many steps ran
                        dense before it and how many rows the sequence has.

    <python> bench/masked_render_time_breakdown.py \
        --rows RUN.jsonl --history-dir DIR [--telemetry-dir DIR] [--server-log LOG] \
        [--label A --label B] [--state A="first prompt after a server start"] \
        --out bench/results/<date>_<name>.json

Prints the tables as Markdown and writes the same numbers to `--out`. Pure
reading: no server, no GPU, no ComfyUI import.

What it does not measure. `REPEAT_KEEPS` and `SONG_ONLY_ON_REPEAT` say what a
second run of the same stretch would pay again; they are read from the code
(the song node's inputs, core's node cache), not timed, and the output labels
every figure built on them `by rule`. A load line is placed in a stage by
laying the stages end to end from the node's start, so it is off by at most
the node's unaccounted seconds, which are printed beside it.
