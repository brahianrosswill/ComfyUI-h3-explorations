"""Check every distill is loaded at the shift and step count it was trained at.

A distill runs on its trainer's contract (`docs/wiki/references.md`): PDD and
FlashGen at the base 12/3 on their own grids, FastH3 V2 at `FASTH3_SHIFT`.
None of them carries its shift in the file, so a graph at the wrong one
renders plausibly wrong and **nothing errors**.

  loaders complete      every node of ours with a `lora_name` input is in
                        `LORA_LOADER_CLASSES`, or its graph reads as a base

  graphs are consistent  EVERY shipped API graph. Each distill is graded on
                        its own contract; a graph with none must sit at the
                        base checkpoint's own 12/3. It FAILS if either
