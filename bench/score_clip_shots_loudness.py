"""Two things a finished clip can be checked for without anyone watching it:
how many cuts it holds against the shots its prompt scripts, and how loud it
is against a reference clip of the same scene.

    python bench/score_clip_shots_loudness.py --shots 3 --reference DENSE-audio.mp4 \\
        --out bench/results/<date>_<what>.json CLIP-audio.mp4 [...]

Written 2026-10-03 for the output check (`bench/results/2026-10-03_sol_output_check.md`).
On the twelve clips the owner judged on 2026-10-02, every sparse-attention
render of the three-shot market scene held a cut the script does not have and
the dense render did not, and the owner's audio verdicts on the dialogue scene
followed loudness against the dense clip. Both were found after the verdicts,
on two scenes; the record says what that does and does not support.

Cuts are `bench/measure_clip_delta.py::cut_times` (ffmpeg's scene score above
its `CUT_SCORE`), with every frame's score kept so a count can be re-read at
another threshold. Loudness is `bench/measure_clip_loudness.py::ebur128`.

It reports. `shots_match` is the one comparison it makes; whether a loudness
difference matters is not decided here. It sees an added or missing cut and a
level change, and nothing else: not identity, faces, artifacts, an action
done wrong inside a shot, or what is said. Basenames only reach the record.
