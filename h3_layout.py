"""MiniMax-H3's packed layout, read from what core publishes.

Core's `MiniMaxH3Model._forward` puts the `PackedLayout` it is about to use in
`transformer_options["minimax_h3_layout"]` before the token refiner runs, and
`transformer_options["block_index"]` before each DiT block
(`comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py`). Everything in this pack that needs segment
bounds or a block index reads them here.

**Why this module exists (2026-09-27).** Until then the Sol node got the same
facts by monkeypatching `PackedLayout.__init__` process-wide and replacing
`model._forward` and `model.rope_freqs` (the Morton machinery), and by hooking
every block to publish `sol_block`. Core publishes both now, so the patching
went with Morton (`docs/research/2026-09-27_sol_node_redesign.md`).

**The one rule: a published value belongs to a call only when the call is as
long as the layout.** Core sets the layout before the two token-refiner calls
(which run on the text span alone) and never clears `block_index`, so the
next step's refiner calls see the previous step's last block. Gating on
`layout.seq_len == tokens` drops both: a refiner call gets no layout and no
block, which is what the old hooks produced too.
