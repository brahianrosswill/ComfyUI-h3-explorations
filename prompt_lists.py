"""Prompt lists: fill `__name__` placeholders, one value per use, no repeat before a list is used up.

`docs/h3_audio_freeze.md` owns the lane that uses these first (the song node's
`lists` input); nothing here is specific to audio. The owner's rules
(2026-09-14), and where each lives:

- **A placeholder is `__name__`.** Not `{name}`, which the frontend's dynamic
  prompts rewrite before a node sees it, and not `[name]` or `<name>`, which
  H3 prompts already use (`[Shot 1]`, `<Subject 1>`). A name is letters and
  digits with single `_`, `-` or `/` separators, so `__dance/verbs__` names a
  file in a subfolder. `PLACEHOLDER`.
- **A list advances only when a window's prompt uses it**, and the same
  placeholder twice in one prompt takes the same value. `resolve_texts`.
- **`shuffled` never repeats a value before the list is used up.** Each pass
  through the list is a fresh shuffle, never the same order as the pass
  before, and with three or more values the first value of a pass is never
  the last of the one before. With more values than uses, no value repeats at
  all. `next_pass`. `in_order` runs the list in order, pass after pass;
  `random` draws independently and may repeat, and is only ever chosen.
- **The seed decides which shuffles, and it holds.** The same seed gives the
  same sequence on every render. The list node declares its seed fixed after
  each queue for the same reason the song node does: a filled-in prompt that
  changes on every queue re-renders every window resume could have kept.

**Every loop fills the same way.** A node that loops over windows inside
itself takes a `lists` input, calls `fill_windows` while it plans, and
fingerprints the wildcard files it may read (`wildcard_fingerprint`), so an
edited file re-runs it. `bench/check_prompt_lists.py` fails a node that writes
windows through `loop_output` or resumes through `loop_resume` without all
three. A graph that loops by chaining nodes, or renders one clip per queue,
uses `MiniMaxH3FillPromptLists`, whose `index` names the use. Value N of a list
is a function of its values, order, seed and N alone, so both routes give the
same values.

**Wildcard files** live in `wildcards/` under ComfyUI's input directory
(`register_wildcards_folder`, the `--input-directory` override included), and
`extra_model_paths.yaml` can add more under the key `wildcards`. A `.txt` holds
one value per line (blank lines and `#` lines skipped); a `.json` holds a list,
or named lists as `{"name": [...]}`. A placeholder with no list node of its
name is looked up there directly (`wildcard_candidates`), shuffled at seed 0;
a list node chooses a file, an order and a seed explicitly.
