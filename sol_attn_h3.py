"""Sol-Attn for MiniMax-H3, on comfy-kitchen's CUDA kernel: `MiniMaxH3Sol`.

**Redesigned 2026-09-27.** `docs/research/2026-09-27_sol_node_redesign.md` is
the plan and the reasons, and `bench/results/2026-09-27_sol_node_compound_audit.md`
the evidence. It replaced `MiniMaxH3SolAttn` (a fork of the vendored upstream
node, 2026-08-30), which is deleted together with the code only it reached:
Morton token reordering, `tau_profile`, top-k (SLA) selection with
`pooled_tail`, the `sol_block` hooks and the `PackedLayout` patch. Git has
them; `vendor/sol_attn_minimax.py` stays as the pristine upstream reference.

## What the kernel takes, and what this node does with each

Read from `comfy_kitchen.sol_attn`'s signature (asserted once, at patch time,
by `_require_kernel`), not from a version string.

  tau               the node's `tau`.
  scale             taken from the caller's kwargs.
  sink_blocks,      H3's conditioning sink, derived from the layout core
  sink_q            publishes (`h3_layout`, `_sink_blocks`).
  tail              always on: the pooled term for unselected blocks IS the
                    method (the SLA lane that turned it off closed).
  topk_ratio        always 0: tau is the only selection.
  token_aug         the node's `token_routing`, per block.
  qk_balance,       the node's `quantizer` (both are fork options; the node
  rotate            refuses at patch time on a build without them).
  blk_cnt           passed only when `H3_SOL_OBSERVE` or `H3_SOL_SWEEP` is armed.
  key_bias          NOT exposed: legal only where the biased keys are
                    sink-covered, which on H3 means the conditioning rows,
                    and the model was never trained against such a bias.
  block_len,        NOT exposed here: they belong to VSA's cube tiling
  coarse_gate       (`vsa_attention.py`, parked; FastH3 uses core's node).

`sol_attn_chunked`, the second entry, is out of reach from an attention
override: it consumes chunks of the fused `qkv_proj` output and applies rope
and RMSNorm itself, and by the time an override is called both have run. Its
memory saving is `MiniMaxH3SolChunked`'s subject (`sol_chunked_h3.py`).

Requires comfy_kitchen with `sol_attn` (bf16 or fp16, head_dim 128, sm_80+).
Calls this node declines (dense_blocks, outside the sigma window, short calls,
masks) run on the attention override under it, which the node names in its
log and settings record.

    ``table_blocks`` (its ``{block: taus per head}``) and ``row_segments``
    (None, or ``{class: exact?}`` over `SEGMENT_CLASSES`) are the per-head and
    per-segment policy (`sparse_table.py`, `row_plan`). With all three None
    the kernel call is the one this node made before they existed. The stamp
    records ``tau_table`` and ``row_segments``; the table's values are
    identified by the hash, not copied (`provenance.py::SOL_CLOSURE_KEYS`).

    The block index and segment bounds come from what core publishes
    (`h3_layout`); a kernel error raises rather than rendering dense
    (`docs/research/2026-09-27_sol_node_redesign.md`).

    ``previous`` chains any override already installed on the model: every path
    that declines hands off to it first, falling through to ``func`` only if
    there is none.

    **Core's container protocol (2026-10-03).** When ``previous`` carries a
    ``container_function`` (core's `set_model_optimized_attention` copies one
    from a backend that has it), the override returned here carries one too,
    and `wrap_attn` then hands q, k and v over in their single-owner containers
    instead of taking them first. A call this node declines passes the
    containers on untouched, so the fallback frees the bf16 q, k and v once it
    has quantized them; before, this frame and `wrap_attn`'s held them for the
    whole dense kernel. A call Sol takes takes the tensors here, as `wrap_attn`
    did. With no ``previous``, or one without a ``container_function`` (the
    sage override), nothing changes: there is no container entry to hand to.
    `bench/results/2026-10-03_sol_container_protocol.json` has the memory and
    the bit-equality of the two kitchen entries this swaps between.

    ``settings`` is the node configuration as a plain dict, recorded by
    `sol_observe` once per distinct configuration and referenced from every
    call row. Unused unless the observer is armed.

# MiniMaxH3Sol: the redesigned node (2026-09-27)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# docs/research/2026-09-27_sol_node_redesign.md is the plan and the reasons;
# bench/results/2026-09-27_sol_node_compound_audit.md is the evidence. What
# differs from MiniMaxH3SolAttn, which it replaced and which was deleted with
# the code only it reached:
#
#   - inputs: tau (the only selection left: the SLA lane closed), one
#     `quantizer` combo in place of the qk_balance and rotate booleans, and
#     token routing as a DynamicCombo whose `custom` option carries its list.
#     No Morton, no tau_profile, no top-k, no pooled_tail (the tail is on).
#   - block index and segment bounds from what core publishes (`h3_layout`);
#     this node patches nothing in core and installs no hooks of its own
#     (the composition hooks for an object-patched sage forward excepted).
#   - it re-installs its override on top at every step, as core's sparse node
#     does, so an attention node placed after it becomes its fallback rather
#     than silently replacing it.
#   - a kernel error raises instead of rendering dense.
#   - bf16 and fp16 are taken; the direct kernel entry accepts both.
#   - the dense fallback under it is named in the log and in the settings
#     record, so a render says which kernel ran its dense calls.
