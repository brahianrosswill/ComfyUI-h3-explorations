"""Capture q/k/v on core's sparse producer path, and change nothing.

Written 2026-09-27 for `docs/open_experiments.md` #45 (is part of FastH3's
over-polish the kitchen's VSA selection?). FastH3's contract graph runs core's
`BlockSparseAttention` (`comfy_extras/nodes_sparse_attention.py`). On the calls
it takes, core swaps each H3 block's attention for its sparse producer, which
projects q/k/v in row chunks inside the kitchen kernel. No full q/k/v tensor
ever exists, and none of this pack's attention paths runs, so
`h3_capture.maybe_capture` is never called. A capture of that graph wrote
nothing.

This node sits after `BlockSparseAttention` and wraps, per block, the block
patch core installed (`patches_replace["dit"][("double_block", i)]`). The
wrapper hands core's patch an `original_block` that swaps the block's
`attention` callable for a capturing one. That callable then:
- projects the fused qkv in core's own `PRODUCER_CHUNK` row chunks, straight
  to host memory, only on a call `H3_CAPTURE` asks for (`h3_capture.wants_pre`);
- writes it through `h3_capture.maybe_capture_pre`, with the rope table and the
  q/k norm weights: everything a grader needs to rebuild the q and k that VSA
  selection sees;
- on a model with VSA gates, also writes the coarse-branch gate's output for
  the same call (`gate_*.pt`), which the qkvpre file cannot rebuild;
- counts the call (`h3_capture.count_call`), since no `maybe_capture` runs on
  this path to advance the step counter;
- calls the attention core chose, unchanged.

The projection is built in core's chunk size. On the VSA path core first
reorders rows into its tiles, so the chunk contents differ from these. The
capture equals core's bytes where the projection is row-independent, which
`h3_capture`'s `chunk_check` measures on the real weights and records in each
file. The GPU cost is one chunk; the host holds the full projection for the
calls written. It stamps `_h3_block_index` on each attention module, as `nodes.py`
does, so block indices survive a model swap within one server.

**Needs `pre=1` or `pre=only` in `H3_CAPTURE`**; `maybe_capture_pre` writes
nothing otherwise. With `H3_CAPTURE` unset, the wrapper calls straight through
and the node is inert. Never put it in a graph where one of this pack's
attention nodes also captures: both would count each call.

Nothing here patches core; the hook is the model patcher's own block-replace
slot, chained onto core's.
