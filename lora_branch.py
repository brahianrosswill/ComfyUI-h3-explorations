"""Apply an H3 LoRA as a separate low-rank branch, so none of it is lost to the int8 grid.

`LoraLoaderModelOnly` merges a LoRA into the weight. On the int8 convrot
checkpoints, ComfyUI does that per layer in
`comfy/ops.py::resolve_cast_module_with_vbar`: dequantize, add the delta,
requantize at a recalculated per-row scale with stochastic rounding, and keep
the result resident. A delta smaller than one int8 step survives only in
expectation, under rounding noise several times its own size.
`bench/results/2026-09-26_int8_lora_requant.json` measures it on real layers:

- FlashGen's delta is about a hundredth of a step, and LightX2V Turbo's about
  a thousandth, in the middle blocks, so the merge keeps almost none of either.
- PDD's and TaoMate's deltas are ten times FlashGen's, and survive in part.

This node leaves the quantized weight alone and adds the LoRA at the call:
`y = W x + s * B (A x)`, exact in the compute dtype. It is `pdd_lora.py`'s
`unmerged_blocks` mechanism (`_make_unmerged_forward`), generalized to any
LoRA and to every module an H3 LoRA targets:

- **A plain Linear** (`qkv_proj`, `out_proj`, `fc1`, `adaln_proj.linear`) takes
  a `forward` object patch.
- **`mlp.fc2` cannot**, because `MLP.forward` calls
  `comfy.ops.linear_input_act(self.fc2, ...)`, which on the int8 path does the
  matmul without calling the module (`pdd_lora.py`, `UNMERGED_KINDS`). So the
  MLP's own `forward` is patched: the stock call, plus `fc2`'s branch applied
  to `swiglu(fc1(x))`.

**Costs.** Two small matmuls per targeted module per call, added into the
base output in place. The A and B matrices stay in pinned host RAM and are
copied to the device per call, `pdd_lora.py`'s reasoning: a rank-64 file
resident on a 24 GB card is about a gigabyte ComfyUI does not account for.

**Formats.** `<prefix>.lora_A.weight` / `.lora_B.weight` (or
`lora_down` / `lora_up`), an optional `.alpha`, and an optional `.diff_b`, under
`diffusion_model.`. Scale is ComfyUI's: `strength * alpha / rank`, or
`strength` with no alpha. Any other key is refused, not skipped.
