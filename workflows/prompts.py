"""The prompt bank as the ONE place prompt text lives, and the lookup that
stamps a render's prompt into its records.

Until 2026-09-03 the generator held every shipped prompt as a string
constant, `prompt_bank/` held a second population that had never rendered,
and nothing joined them: the catalogue derived scenes from the graphs and
named them after the constants, the bank graded its own files, and a record
of a render named its workflow file and nothing about what was rendered.
Every real-activation Sol number in the repo came from one scene as a
result, and nobody could tell from a record which. The owner's call: one
source of truth for prompt text, adaptable where the text allows, and the
exact prompt in every record.

So: `prompt_bank/<id>.txt` is the text, `prompt_bank/bank.json` is the
manifest (mode, frames, donor, brief), and the generator's constants are
now `text("<id>")`. The constant NAMES stay, because the bench scripts and
the catalogue read them; only the literal moved. A prompt that is not in
the bank cannot be shipped, which is the invariant this module exists for.

**That invariant covers COMPOSED prompts since later the same day.** The
ref2va arms are built from role tables by `build_workflows._ref_prompt` and
the two keyframe defaults resolve a duration into their Part One line, so
they arrive as output rather than as an id and had stayed outside the bank
-- the catalogue could only name them `derived:<graph>`. The generator now
looks its composed text up through `identify` and ships the bank's copy,
refusing to build otherwise, so `describe` resolves an id for every prompt
the repo renders rather than for most of them.

`describe(graph)` is the record side: given an API graph it returns the
bank id (or None for a foreign prompt), the text's sha256, the length,
canvas and seed, so `bench/run_graph_arms.py` rows and the Sol route
record's render row say what was rendered rather than only which file.

`carriers(graph)` is the read side for GRADERS: which nodes of a graph carry
prompt text and what the encoder reads from each (a song node's template
expanded through its Prompt Lists). `h3_config.PROMPT_INPUTS` is the one
registry of carrier classes; nothing else keeps a list of them.

No torch, no ComfyUI: importable from the generator and the bench.
