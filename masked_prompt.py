"""The node that writes the masked video-to-video prompt.

`masked_prompt_text.py` holds every sentence and says where each came from;
this is the node on top of it. Wire `prompt` into the song node's `prompt`
and the Masked Source's `source` into this node: the text then names the
motion reference exactly when the Masked Source builds one, and describes
what it replaces, so the two cannot disagree (until 2026-10-06 turning the
motion reference on with an older text left `<Video 1>` unnamed, and nothing
said so).

**Four things to set, and what the node works out itself.** `subject` is
who the still shows, in the user's words, and is the one input most renders
need: it completes a sentence the tooltip shows. The pronouns are read off
it. `voice` and `picture_gives` are choices with a default that fits most
clips, and `picture_gives` reads the Masked Source unless told otherwise.
`add_to_shot` is free text for one render. Whether the text names
`<Video 1>` is never set here: it follows the Masked Source. Above the text,
the node shows one line per input saying what it did with it, so nothing it
worked out is hidden.

**What the `source` wire costs.** The song node's `preview` asks for no
loader and no model, but it does ask for its prompt, and this node asks for
the Masked Source. So with `source` wired, a preview tracks the subject the
first time (the mask is kept, and the render that follows tracks nothing).
Reading the two settings from the queued graph instead would avoid that and
was not done: core computes a node's cache fingerprint without the graph
(`execution.py`, the `fingerprint_inputs` call passes no prompt), so a
changed setting on the Masked Source would have left this node's old text in
the cache.

To change one sentence for every render, edit the constant in
`masked_prompt_text.py`; to write the whole text by hand, type it into the
song node's `prompt` as before and leave this node out.
